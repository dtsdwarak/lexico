#Lexico

##It is...

A dictionary with a web interface powered by WebSpeechAPI. UI is fairly responsive, although I cannot guarantee. :D Uses nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Dictionary powered by [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com/). Alternatively, you can also use, [Words API](https://www.wordsapi.com/)

##To run it

* Clone the repository
* Serve the files through any standard webserver

##Documentation

The application uses just [speech-to-text](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API) synthesis although WebSpeech API supports [text-to-speech](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/01/Web-apps-that-talk---Introduction-to-the-Speech-Synthesis-API) as well. I strongly suggest you go through [HTML5Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/) blog for more information on implementing the same. For simplicity sake, I've also included an example file.
